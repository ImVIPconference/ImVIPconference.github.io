The Welcome Reception will be held at the Queen's Graduate School and the Conference Dinner at Deanes at Queen's Restaurant near the University. 
		As an organising committee, we have been cognizant of the local guidelines regarding COVID-19 and have planned, and utilised, mechanisms to mitigate risks during the conference. These measure have included good ventilation at all venues and use of venues that enable delegates to space out as they feel comfortable. Additionally, hand sanitiser and anti-bacterial wipes will be available for all delegates and speakers will be more than 2m away from the audience.
		In line with Queen's University guidelines, face coverings are strongly encouraged and attendees are advised to take a LFD test before attending the conference. You should not attend the conference if you feel unwell or are self-isolating.
